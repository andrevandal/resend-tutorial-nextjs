# How do I add an unsubscribe link to my emails?

Learn how to give email recipients the ability to unsubscribe without searching for the unsubscribe link.
Resend currently doesnâ€™t manage contact list. If you manage your own list, you can add a List-Unsubscribe: `https://example.com/unsubscribe` header when sending emails using the Resend API.

```js
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend('re_123456789');

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'Acme <onboarding@resend.dev>',
  to: ['delivered@resend.dev'],
  subject: 'hello world',
  text: 'it works!',
  headers: {
    'List-Unsubscribe': '<https://example.com/unsubscribe>',
  },
});
```
